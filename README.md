# Advent of Code 2022 with C++

In an effort to get more used to modern C++, I'm working through AOC this year with C++, a language that I do not often get to use professionally. W00t.

__Note:__ Often (but not always) the solutions here reflect the final "part" of each problem (i.e., it's been hacked away at a whee bit).

## Inputs

All input prompts are downloaded from the AOC website, and saved in the `input` directory with the following format: `[problem #].txt`. For example, the input for the first problem is saved in `input/1.txt`.
